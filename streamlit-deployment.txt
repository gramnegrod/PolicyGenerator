# Deploying Your OpenAI Chat App on Streamlit Sharing

Streamlit Sharing provides a free and easy way to deploy your Streamlit app. Follow these steps to get your app online in minutes:

## 1. Prepare Your Project

Make sure your project structure looks like this:

```
openai-chat-streamlit/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── .streamlit/
    └── secrets.toml (optional, for local testing)
```

## 2. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your project files to the repository:

```bash
# Initialize a git repository
git init

# Add your files
git add app.py requirements.txt

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Deploy on Streamlit Sharing

1. Go to [Streamlit Sharing](https://share.streamlit.io/) and sign in with your GitHub account
2. Click on "New app"
3. Select your repository, branch (main), and the path to your app file (app.py)
4. Click "Deploy"

## 4. Add Your OpenAI API Key

1. Once deployed, go to your app settings
2. Navigate to the "Secrets" section
3. Add your OpenAI API key in the following format:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

4. Save your secrets

## 5. Your App is Live!

Streamlit Sharing will provide you with a public URL for your app (typically something like https://share.streamlit.io/your-username/your-repo-name/main/app.py).

## Local Development

For local development, you can create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your API key:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

Then run your app with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes

- The free tier of Streamlit Sharing has certain limitations, including:
  - Public repositories only
  - Apps sleep after inactivity
  - Limited compute resources
  
- If you need more resources or private repositories, consider Streamlit's paid options or other hosting solutions.

- Remember to never commit your API keys to GitHub. Always use secrets management.
